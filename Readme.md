# Java Projects
Welcome to the Java Projects repository! This repository is a collection of Java projects, each containing their corresponding source codes. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Java or an experienced developer seeking inspiration, this repository has something for everyone.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a unique Java project. Inside each project directory, you will find the following files and folders:

1. **Source Code**: This folder contains all the Java source code files (.java) for the project. These files contain the actual implementation of the project's functionalities.

2. **Dependencies**: If the project requires any external libraries or dependencies, you will find them in this folder. These dependencies are necessary for the project to compile and run successfully.

3. **Documentation**: This folder may contain any relevant documentation, including README files, user guides, or API references. Be sure to check this folder for any specific instructions or guidelines related to the project.

4. **Build Files**: In some cases, you might find build files like build.gradle or pom.xml in the project directory. These files specify the project's build configurations and dependencies, and they are used by build tools such as Gradle or Maven.
